"""

A module initializer for a Python package or library.

This special module, `__init__.py`, is executed when the package it is in is
imported. It can be used to initialize a package, setting up any necessary
package-wide state or imports. The presence of an `__init__.py` file in a
directory indicates to python that the directory should be treated as a package.

Typically, this file contains initialization code that is run as soon as the
package is imported. This can include importing submodules, defining variables,
or any other initialization logic that should occur when the package is loaded.

Attributes:
    This module typically does not define attributes, but it may import and
    alias attributes from submodules for convenience.

Functions:
    The `__init__.py` module may define functions if necessary for initializing
    the package. It could also expose a public API by importing and optionally
    renaming functions from the package's modules.

Classes:
    Similar to functions, the `__init__.py` module may define classes or import
    them from different modules within the package to expose them as a part of
    the package's public API.

Exceptions:
    Any package-specific exceptions may be defined or imported here to be made
    available to users of the package.
