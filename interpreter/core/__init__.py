"""
A module initializer for a Python package or library.

This module (`__init__.py`) serves as the initialization script that is executed when the package directory is encountered. It can be used to set up the package environment, define what symbols the package exports, and perform any necessary setup required for the package's components to function properly.

Typically, it contains import statements to include necessary modules within the package, initialization code that runs when the package is first imported, and often, a version number for the package. It may also contain other code to configure the package behavior, but that is not a strict requirement.
