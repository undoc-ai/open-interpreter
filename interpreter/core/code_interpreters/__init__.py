Module __init__

This module initializes the package. It sets up the necessary environment
and variables needed for the package to function properly. This includes
configuring paths, setting up any default settings, and initializing state that
will be used across various modules within the package.

Typically, this module will be executed first when the package is imported,
ensuring that all the requisite initializations take place before any
other modules, classes, or functions are utilized.
