A module containing a `BaseCodeInterpreter` class which serves as a template for building code interpreter classes.

This module defines `BaseCodeInterpreter` that provides a basic interface for interpreting code. The class is intended to be subclassed to create specific code interpreters for different programming languages or environments.

class BaseCodeInterpreter:
    """
    A base class that defines the structure for a code interpreter.
    This class is intended to be subclassed to create specific interpreters for different
    programming languages or environments. It provides the basic interface that all interpreters
    should implement, ensuring consistency and reusability of the code.
    Attributes:
        There are no public attributes in this class.
    Methods:
        __init__(self):
            Initializes a new instance of BaseCodeInterpreter. This method is expected to be
            overridden by subclasses if they need to perform any initialization.
        run(self, code):
            Executes the given code within the context of the interpreter. This is an abstract
            method that should be implemented by subclasses. The method should provide a way
            to run code snippets and potentially return output or results.
            Args:
                code (str): A string of code to be interpreted and executed by the interpreter.
            Returns:
                The method's return value should be determined by the subclass implementation
                and based on the behavior of the particular interpreter.
        terminate(self):
            Shuts down the interpreter and cleans up any resources used by the interpreter.
            This is an abstract method that should be implemented by subclasses to ensure
            proper resource management and shutdown procedures are in place.
            It should be noted that the actual behavior of this method is dependent on the
            specifics of the interpreter implementation and may vary between different
            subclasses.
    """

    def __init__(self):
        """
        Initializes a new instance of the class.
        This method is the constructor for the class. It's called when a new instance of the class is created. The method is empty and does not perform any action, initialization, or configuration beyond the basic creation of an object in memory.
        Args:
            There are no arguments for this method.
        Raises:
            There are no expected errors or exceptions raised by this method.

        pass

    def run(self, code):
        """
        Runs the provided code within the context of this object.
        Args:
            code (str): A string containing the code to be executed.
        Returns:
            The result of executing the code, which could be of any type depending on the code's behavior.
        Raises:
            Exception: If there is an error while executing the code.

        """
        Terminates the current process or thread gracefully, ensuring that any cleanup operations are performed before shutting down.
            This method should be called when the process or thread needs to be stopped, and it ensures that all resources are properly released and any necessary shutdown procedures are executed. The actual implementation details of the cleanup and shutdown sequence are dependent on the context in which this method is used.
