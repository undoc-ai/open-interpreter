Module __init__.

This module is the initializer for its containing package. Typically, the __init__.py file makes a Python directory a package, enabling it to be imported similarly to a module. When a package is imported, the __init__.module is executed and is responsible for initializing the package's environment.

In this __init__.py module, you might find import statements to include submodules, as well as __all__ directive to control what is exported with the package. This could include module level variables, class and function definitions that are meant to be public when the package is imported. It is also commonly used to set up any necessary package-level data structures, state, or registration of types (in cases like databases that need models to be registered).

Attributes:
    __all__ (list): An optional list of strings defining what symbols will be exported when 'from package import *' is used.
