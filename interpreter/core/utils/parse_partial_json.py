Module: parse_partial_json

This module provides a function to attempt parsing of improperly formatted JSON strings by correcting simple errors and manipulating the string to make it a valid JSON. The primary functionality is delivered through the `parse_partial_json` function.

Functions:
    def parse_partial_json(s: str) -> Union[dict, list, None]:
        '''Attempts to parse a JSON string that may not be properly formatted.

        Takes a string that is expected to be in JSON format, but may have errors such as missing
        closing brackets or improper string escape sequences. The function processes the string,
        attempting to correct any formatting issues and parse it into a valid JSON object. If the string
        cannot be parsed even after corrections, it returns None.

        Args:
            s (str): The JSON-like string to be parsed for conversion into a JSON object.

        Returns:
            Union[dict, list, None]: A dictionary or list if the string can be parsed into a JSON
                                   object, otherwise None if parsing is unsuccessful.

        Raises:
            json.JSONDecodeError: If the corrected string is still not a valid JSON, this exception
                                  is caught but not re-raised; None is returned instead.

    Processes a string that contains partial JSON data and attempts to correct and parse it as a valid JSON object.
    This function is designed to handle strings where the JSON may be prematurely truncated, missing closing brackets,
    or containing newlines that need to be escaped. It works by first trying to parse the string as is and, if it fails,
    cleans and reconstructs it before trying to parse again.
    Parameters:
        s (str): The partial JSON string to be parsed.
    Returns:
        dict or None: The function returns a dictionary if the JSON parsing was successful after the corrections,
    or None if the parsing still fails after all the corrections have been applied.
