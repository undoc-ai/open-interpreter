"""

Module-level docstring for the `__init__` module of a Python package.

This module serves as the initializer for a package. It is the first to be loaded when the package is imported. The `__init__.py` file within a directory indicates that the directory should be treated as a package. This module can be used to set up the package-level variables, import necessary submodules or dependencies, define the `__all__` variable for specifying what symbols the package exports, or execute any initialization code needed for the package to function properly.

Attributes:
    __package__ (str): Denotes the package name.
    __all__ (list of str): Optionally specifies which modules or names are exported from the package when `from package import *` is used.
